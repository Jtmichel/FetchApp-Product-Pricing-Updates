FetchApp Pricing Updater
================

A Simple PHP script for updating pricing across all products in FetchApp


* Run mamp (or a php server)
* src/index.php contains a form for your FetchApp info
* You'll be taken to a page to review your pricing changes
* May take forever (size limitations, needs pagination?)
